# OpenAg Eagle Library
Common Parts Library for PCBs designed in Eagle for OpenAg

## Usage
1. When starting a new design, fork this library onto your personal github account
2. Clone your fork into the eagle library on your local machine
3. Use an existing component whenever possible to maximize the number of shared parts between designs
4. Add new components as needed
5. Once the PCB has been fabricated and tested, create a pull request back to the OpenAgInitiative's eagle library repo
6. Merge must be approved by someone other than you
